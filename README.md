# RemoteControlWithJava

This is a small Java listener/keylogger project.

HOW TO USE:
 1. Run server.java. NOTE: do not close the program or else you cannot use the listener, you can close the program after you have finished using the listener
 2. Run client.java. Enter port number (1234), click connect to connect to server
 3. Choose anything you like to do with the host from the client menu

From client, you can:
  1. Get screenshot from server
  2. Get typed key from server
  3. See running apps/processes of server
  4. Shutdown server
